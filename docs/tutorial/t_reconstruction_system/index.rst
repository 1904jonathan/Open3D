Reconstruction system (Tensor)
===================================================================

This tutorial demonstrates volumetric RGB-D reconstruction and dense volumetric RGB-D SLAM with the :ref:`/tutorial/core/tensor.ipynb` interface and the :ref:`/tutorial/core/hashmap.ipynb` backend.

The tutorials for tensor-based offline reconstruction system, simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC), and shape from shading (SfS) are under construction. At current, please refer to :ref:`reconstruction_system` for several legacy versions.
