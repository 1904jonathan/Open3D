Reconstruction system (Tensor)
===================================================================

This tutorial demonstrates volumetric RGB-D reconstruction and dense volumetric RGB-D SLAM with the :ref:`/tutorial/core/tensor.ipynb` interface and the :ref:`/tutorial/core/hashmap.ipynb` backend.
The tensor-based offline reconstruction system is under construction. At current, please refer to :ref:`reconstruction_system` for its legacy version.
