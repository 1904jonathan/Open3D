Reconstruction system (Tensor)
===================================================================

This tutorial demonstrates volumetric RGB-D reconstruction and dense volumetric RGB-D SLAM with the Tensor interface.
The tensor-based offline reconstruction system is under construction.
At current, please refer to :ref:`reconstruction_system` for the legacy offline reconstruction system.
