RGBD Images

==================================================================================================

A RGB-D image is a combination of a RGB image and its corresponding depth image.  A depth image is an 
image channel in which each pixel relates to a distance between the image plane and the corresponding object in the RGB image.

In order to estimate it, you may need to estimate the depth from images of the same scene taken from multiple cameras, thus coming down to a computer vision problem. 
Another solution is to collect traning data containing RGB-D images and to use machine learning techniques.

The tools that can be used to calculate RGBD Images - OpenKinect, Microsoft Kinect for Windows and OpenNI.

Why is it used?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the applications are -

(1) 3D Reconstruction
(2) Augmented Reality
(3) Image Processing
(4) Interaction
(5) Robotic
(6) Object Recognition

There are several other possibilities of to use the Kinect:
robot navigation and control, entertainment (like shows), and
interaction (on other platforms besides Kinect).
