Mesh

====================================================

A mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape of a polyhedral object 
in 3D computer graphics and solid modeling. It forms a polygon mainly triangles (triangle mesh), 
quadrilaterals (quads), simple convex polygons,  concave polygons, or even polygons with holes.
Thus, the core of a model is the mesh which is best described as a collection of points in space.


Why are the used?

=====================================================

These 3D objects can be generated automatically or created manually by deforming the mesh, or otherwise manipulating vertices.
3D models are used for a variety of mediums including video games, movies, architecture, illustration, engineering, and commercial advertising.
The 3D modeling process produces a digital object capable of being fully animated, making it an essential process for character animation and special effects.
