Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software
that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected
data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly
optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from
the open-source community.

Core features of Open3D includes:

* 3D data structures
* 3D data processing algorithms
* Scene reconstruction
* Surface alignment
* 3D visualization
* Available in C++ and Python

For more, please visit the [Open3D documentation](http://www.open3d.org/docs).

## Python quick start

Pre-built pip and conda packages support Ubuntu 18.04+, up-to-date macOS and
Windows 64-bit with Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. If you have other Python
versions or operating systems, please
[compile Open3D from source](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html).

* To install Open3D with pip:

    ```bash
    $ pip install open3d
    ```

* To install Open3D with Conda:

    ```bash
    $ conda install -c open3d-admin open3d
    ```

* To compile Open3D from source:
    * See [compiling from source](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html).

Test your installation with:

```bash
$ python -c "import open3d as o3d"
```

and follow the [basic tutorials](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/Basic/index.html)
or [Python examples](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/tree/master/examples/Python) to get
started.

## C++ quick start

Please refer to [compiling from source](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html)
and [Open3D C++ interface](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/C++/cplusplus_interface.html).

## Open3D standalone viewer app (New!)

Open3D now comes with a standalone
[3D viewer app](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/releases) available on
Ubuntu and macOS. Stay tuned for Windows.
